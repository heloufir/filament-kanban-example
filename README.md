## Key Features

1. **Status-Based Visualization**

With the first version of Filament Kaban, you can visualize your project records in a Kanban-style layout, categorizing them into status columns. This provides a clear and concise view of your work at hand, making it easy to track progress and prioritize tasks.

2. **Status Management**

Effortlessly manage the status of your records. Change the status of your tasks with a few simple drag and drop behaviour, ensuring that your project reflects the most up-to-date information at all times.

3. **Status Sorting**

Tailor the order of status columns to suit your project's workflow. Arrange them in the way that best aligns with your process and preferences, providing you with flexibility and control.

4. **Record Interaction**

Click on records within the Kanban board to trigger Livewire events, enabling seamless interactions and updates without navigating away from the board. This feature simplifies the management of tasks and enhances your overall project workflow.
